As creatives it can sometimes feel like our output depends entirely on our mood. We dread going through spells where work can feel like an uphill battle. The truth is these dry spells are inevitable and it’s important that we have the skills and perseverance to get through them. I’ve put together a few things that help me, hopefully they’ll help you too.

## Stop the comparisons. Today.

It’s a great habit to observe your peer’s work but it’s important to always remember that design is not a competition. Be inspired and take influence from those talented people in your industry but remember nothing good can come from comparisons. Why not compare today’s work to your work a year ago?

## Allow your skill to catch up with your taste

Ira Glass puts it better than I could:

> Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me. All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it&#8217;s just not that good. It&#8217;s trying to be good, it has potential, but it&#8217;s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit

Excerpt from [this interview](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BI23U7U2aUY&feature=player_embedded).

## Educate yourself

Pick up a book, address that growing Instapaper queue. Learning a new skill or reinforcing an established skill can motivate you more than you realise. Don’t constrain yourself to your own industry, look further afield and prepare to be surprised by the results.

## Stop finding excuses not to work

“It would be so much better if&#8230;” “If only it wasn’t&#8230;”. You will never land a perfect project. You will never have the perfect client. Your office will never be the perfect temperature.

## Switch it up

Change your working habits &#8211; wake up at 5 am or stay up till 3am &#8211; work in a coffee shop or public library. I find nothing grinds me down more than a routine. Take advantage of all the flexibility your job can offer.

## Get healthy

Eat better food; drink more water; take more exercise; sleep longer. Don’t underestimate the power of fresh air and daylight. A brisk walk, a jog or a bike ride can lift your mood and change your perspective.

## Keep a to-do list

Keeping a to-do list can be a challenge in itself. I don’t put everything on mine, only the menial tasks I’m likely to forget. When I’m not in the mood for creative work I tackle the to-do list. Knowing I’ve got a few of those boring jobs out of the way can boost my mood enough to get me back in the game.

## Maintain your working environment

Keep your workspace clean and tidy. Invest in some decent lighting and a few pictures for the walls. Ensure you have a door to shut or some quality headphones so you can enjoy a quiet moment. You’re more likely to spend time in a workspace that’s a pleasure to be in.

## Separate work and play

Don’t work on the sofa, don’t play at your desk. If you work in an office don’t bring your work home with you. It seems like a simple thing but when home working is commonplace and remote working is so easy  you’d be surprised how much the line can blur.

## Don’t stop working

The worst thing you can do is sit around and wait for inspiration to find you. When you are feeling at your worst it is tempting to fire up the xbox, lose yourself in social networking or watch those endless reruns.

> Inspiration exists, but it has to find you working. – Pablo Picasso

The longer you spend away from work the harder it will be to pick it up again. The more you work, the more you work.
