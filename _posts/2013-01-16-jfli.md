I&#8217;m sticking to my self-imposed deadline and launching my new site tonight. It&#8217;s not quite finished, I&#8217;m sure there are plenty of bugs and the portfolio section is missing some projects but hey, it&#8217;s live.

I&#8217;ll follow up with a post about what I&#8217;ve done and why I&#8217;ve done it shortly. In the meantime I&#8217;m going to enjoy a beer and a nice sit down.
