At new year I decided 2012 would be the year I would move on from local government, but at the time I had no ideaÂ what that would mean.

So here we are, barely halfway through the year and it&#8217;s happened. At the end of June I&#8217;ll be leaving Shropshire Council&#8217;s web team and joining the design team at [Torchbox](http://torchbox.com).

I&#8217;ll be sad to leave the many friends I have made over the past five years but won&#8217;t lie about the fact I&#8217;m counting the days until I can start with the team down in Oxfordshire. I&#8217;m looking forward to the many challenges a new job brings, as well as spending some time in one of the most beautiful parts of our little country.

Shropshire will always be home, and the fond memories I have of working in government means I intend to remain active in both communities whenever I can.
