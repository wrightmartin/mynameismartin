Friday is my last day at Torchbox. It&#8217;s sad news, but with our second child on the way we&#8217;ve decided to move back to Shrewsbury to be closer to family.

I joined Torchbox in July last year and moved to Witney with my wife and daughter in October, we love Oxfordshire but underestimated how much living close to family and friends meant to us, especially with young children. It wasn&#8217;t an easy decision to leave but we&#8217;re sure it&#8217;s the right one.

Over the past year I&#8217;ve had the pleasure of working with an extremely talented team on some challenging and exciting projects and am grateful for the experience, I&#8217;ve grown both professionally and personally and am looking forward to turning my attention to a new challenge,Â my new job at [MySociety](http://www.mysociety.org/).
