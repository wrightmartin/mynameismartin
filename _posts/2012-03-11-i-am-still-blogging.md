I am guilty once again of neglecting this blog but have a good excuse for once.  I&#8217;m having all my blogging mojo consumed by [Project WIP](http://shropshire.gov.uk/projectwip) while we work on a project to redesign shropshire.gov.uk. We&#8217;re trying our very best to document everything we are doing in a series of blog posts.

Here&#8217;s a handy [link to my posts](http://shropshire.gov.uk/projectwip/author/martin/).
