I&#8217;ve just gone live with my new design. It has been a week of hard work and late nights but it&#8217;s finally coming together and I just couldn&#8217;t wait any longer to launch it.

### So what&#8217;s new?

  * A brand new [portfolio section](http://mynameismartin.com/portfolio) &#8211; it&#8217;s not particularly populous at the moment, but it&#8217;s a place to show all my personal and freelance work
  * Much simpler layout and design &#8211; when I made version 1 it didn&#8217;t have a clear purpose, I wasn&#8217;t sure how much freelance work I wanted and how much I would be writing so the site always struggled with split personality. Hopefully that will end now
  * No more contact form mess &#8211; if you want to contact me email me martin[at]mynameismartin.com or send me a tweet [@thenameismartin](http://twitter.com/thenameismartin)
  * Typekit
  * and more to come&#8230;

As always I&#8217;m open to your feedback, this site will always be a work in progress. I&#8217;ll be following shortly with a post about some of my design decisions and will upload a few early designs.
