I will be writing a more detailed blog post about it, once I&#8217;ve ironed out some of the details. But here it is, <a href="http://www.martinanddonna.co.uk" target="_blank">the site for our wedding</a>. Still to do:

  * Cross browser testing &#8211; I have no idea what it looks like in IE6 or 7 or Firefox pre 3.6
  * Font stacks &#8211; The ampersand in the logo is Palatino, I need to do some research into how widely available that font is
  * Build an RSVP form

Anyways, enjoy and be sure to feedback
