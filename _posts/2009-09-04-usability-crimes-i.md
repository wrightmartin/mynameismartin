Occasionally, in my capacity as a web user I spot things so terrible, so badly thought out and so downright arrogant it makes me sad. Below is one such thing…

<img class="size-large wp-image-70" title="ing-usability-large" alt="ing-usability-large" src="/assets/img/blog-post-images/2009/09/ing-usability-large.jpg" srcset="/assets/img/blog-post-images/2009/09/ing-usability-large.jpg 913w, /assets/img/blog-post-images/2009/09/ing-usability-large-300x239.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 913px) 100vw, 913px" /> 

If you can&#8217;t quite make it out, let me explain. Thats an input for a memorable date and a PIN number when opening an account, and they have disabled your keyboard completely so you must enter the numbers by clicking the onscreen keypad.

UPDATE: Since opening my account I have locked myself out twice, why? Because to add to the confusion the order of the numbers on the keypad changes every visit.
