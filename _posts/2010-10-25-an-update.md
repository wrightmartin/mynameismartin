Holy crap where has the time gone?

I got married, moved house and we are about to go to Australia for three weeks. I haven&#8217;t done anything since relaunching my site and probably won&#8217;t until the new year &#8211; but fear not.

In 2011 I will return and I will be taking on some more freelance jobs, I&#8217;m pumped about web design at the moment having just read through [Andy Clarke](http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/)&#8216;s book, [Hardboiled web design](http://hardboiledwebdesign.com/) and am getting excited already.

Here&#8217;s to next year!
