Steve Balmer once said “developers, developers, developers, developers, developers, developers&#8230;” well, you get the idea. It seems Local Government took this tirade to heart and started hiring developers, developers developers&#8230;

Fast forward to today and we find ourselves with a problem. Take a look at any Local Government website or web application and you&#8217;ll see screen after screen designed by developers and software engineers.

Wild statement: **There are no designers in Local Government**.

I wasn&#8217;t hired as a designer, nor was anyone in my team. We were hired as a developers. Luckily for my employer we had some design skills. In fact I was a designer disguised as a developer (I left my checked shirt and glasses at home) so they hit the jackpot.

So why are Local Authorities happy to leave design to the luck of the draw? We&#8217;ve recently seen authorities hiring a vast range of web professionals &#8211; web copywriters, content strategists, service designers (I think thats code for business analysts) and I&#8217;ve started to hear whispers about a mysterious new thing called &#8216;UX&#8217;. But what will it take for us to start hiring designers?

Surely I don&#8217;t have to reiterate the benefits of good design? We all know that it saves money if we can move our services online; but here&#8217;s a thought. What if we made them easy? Pleasurable? Memorable? You can&#8217;t do that without a designer.
