This site has been up for just under a year, and I&#8217;ve learnt a lot Â so I&#8217;ve decided to take a break from freelance work to rethink and redesign.

### What does this mean?

  * The general look and feel has come to feel quite clunky and over simple, I&#8217;d like to make it a bit more delicate and thought out, but still retain the same general feel
  * I&#8217;m not counting on using my site to find freelance work via cold enquiries, so less of a &#8216;salesy&#8217; tone to the copy
  * I&#8217;m not posting to my blog as often as I could be, due to some decisions made in the last design. I&#8217;d like to go much more down the Tumblr route and make the blog less about articles and more about bookmarking and sharing.
  * I&#8217;m using Twitter more and more so I&#8217;ll put that as a higher priority on the site
  * If I can, I&#8217;ll do it all on one page.

I&#8217;ll do my best to post my progress as I go, as I did with this version.
