  Web design and development services are expensive and out of reach for small charities and non-profit organisations, pro-bono work is a great way to use your skills for a good cause.
</p>

For those just starting out in their careers pro bono work is a great way to gain experience and build a portfolio of professional work, and even veterans of the web industry will have something to gain from working on smaller projects for something other than money.

But just because you&#8217;re working for free doesn&#8217;t mean you shouldn&#8217;t treat the project with all the professionalism you would a paid job, and all the caution too. That means agreeing a contract, setting realistic expectations andÂ being prepared to say no.

So, pick a (preferably) local organisation, roll up your sleeves and use a few of your spare hours to help those in need. Here are a few links to help get you started
