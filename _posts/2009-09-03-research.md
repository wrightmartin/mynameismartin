Research is about determining best practice, finding out if something is possible, or seeing how others have solved the same problems. Research is a process, it takes a lot of time and should be recognised as legitimate phase in a project, just like design, development and testing. 

Research is a diverse activity and can range from reading industry blogs and magazines and interviewing clients to looking at the competition and the wider industry. It can be used to predict customer needs, support or inform your decision making and as a catalyst for change. 

Research is not wasted time, and past research should always be kept handy. You never know when you&#8217;re going to encounter the same problem again, or find another use for some prototype code or wireframe. Having a good repository of research means you have something to refer back to, although managing this research repository can be large task in itself, there are [plenty](http://www.evernote.com "Evernote") of [tools](http://www.getdropbox.com "Dropbox") [around](http://www.imgspark.com/ "Image Spark") around to help. 

We should not be afraid of approaching new challenges or doing things we have never done before, if we use research it can help the unknown become known, it can turn guesses into more concrete, realistic estimates and most of all it can help us broaden our knowledge and experience. 

I think too often in the design community we like to jump right into the design stage of a project, relying on inspiration or chance to help us, but taking a moment to research can lead to better decisions, better designs and most importantly better websites.
