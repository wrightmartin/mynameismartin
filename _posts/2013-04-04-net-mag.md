A few months ago I was invited by .net magazine to take part in their monthly build-off challenge. The task was to design a homepage for a hypothetical independent cinema.

It&#8217;s issue number [240](http://www.netmagazine.com/shop/magazines/may-2013-240) on the shelves this month, which means I finally have something physical I can show my parents to help explain what it is I do all day.
