I&#8217;ve started posting my bookmarks and interesting links to a Tumblr – [Design is Sport](http://designissport.tumblr.com/).

I&#8217;ve been through countless bookmarking tools and for various reasons have never stuck with one for long enough for it to be useful. I want to be able to share things in an easy way and want to browse my bookmarks visually and at the moment it seems that Tumblr combined with [Ember](http://www.realmacsoftware.com/ember) is the best way to do this, even if the process is a bit clunky at the moment.
