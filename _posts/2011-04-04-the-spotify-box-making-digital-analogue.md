This is a proof of concept made by [Jordi Parra](http://blog.zenona.com/ "Jordi Parra") for his degree project and it really is something special. For me Spotify playlists are the closest you can get to modern day mix tapes but Jordi takes it to whole new level and makes me really miss the permanence and sincerity of a C-90.
