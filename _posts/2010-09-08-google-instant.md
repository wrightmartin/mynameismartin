Google have started rolling out <a title="Google Instant" href="http://www.google.co.uk/instant/" target="_blank">Google Instant</a>, a new feature of their search engineÂ today.

Once enabled Google Instant performs your search and begins fetching results as you type, something that has to be experienced. I like it, but it will take some getting used to.
