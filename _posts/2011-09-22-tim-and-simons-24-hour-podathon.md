Local comedy podcast duo [Tim and Simon](http://timandsimon.co.uk "Tim and Simon") announced a pretty cool project today; on the 27th of September they will be recording and releasing 24 podcasts in 24 hours all in the name of charity. They&#8217;ve got a Â£1000 target to meet to so [go and help them](http://timandsimon.co.uk/podathon). All proceeds go to The Alzheimer&#8217;s Society, and having had a Grandfather who was a sufferer I couldn&#8217;t think of a more deserving cause.
