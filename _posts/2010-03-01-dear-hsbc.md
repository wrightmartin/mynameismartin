Dear HSBC,

Saving for a wedding means I&#8217;ve been checking my various internet banking accounts quite often, and although yours is one of the better ones, there&#8217;s something that&#8217;s been bothering me. You see, when I get to your homepage, I have to click through to log-in on a separate page. How about shortening my journey slightly?

It may not seem like much, but one thing I&#8217;ve learnt is when it comes to customer experience is that it&#8217;s all in the details. Your customer&#8217;s time is valuable and you should make every effort to streamline your processes.
