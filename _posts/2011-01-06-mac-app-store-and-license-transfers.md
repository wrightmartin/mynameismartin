The <a href="http://www.apple.com/mac/app-store/" target="_blank">Mac App Stor</a>e launched today to much fanfare, bringing with it the first apps available for purchase and download. There is fair amount of launch day content (although <a href="http://macrabbit.com/espresso/" target="_blank">Espresso</a> is currently absent, which will be my first purchase) including Twitter for Mac.

It&#8217;s not all great though, as it turns out there is noÂ <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/01/06/panic-mac-app-store" target="_blank">way to transfer an app purchase to the new app store</a>, meaning you miss out on auto updates and other benefits unless you repurchase the license. So the iLife 11 upgrade I bought in October will have to stay in application limbo until the next paid-for upgrade.

As has become the usual from Apple, bittersweet.
