Next Wednesday (7th August 2013) I&#8217;ll be talking at [Oxford Geek Nights](http://oxford.geeknights.net/). For five glorious minutes I&#8217;ll talk you through what I do to fill the gaps in research, discovery and domain knowledge when working on client projects, and what to do when all you have to go on is your gut.

My microslot talk is called &#8216;Designing without data&#8217; and yes, I started with the title and worked backwards.
