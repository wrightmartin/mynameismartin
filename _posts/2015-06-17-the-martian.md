Yesterday, I started reading [The Martian](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0091956145/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0091956145&linkCode=as2&tag=mynameismarti-21&linkId=IVXU7ZXFOVDFI36Z)<img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://ir-uk.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=mynameismarti-21&l=as2&o=2&a=0091956145" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" /> and today I finished it. It&#8217;s been over a five years since I last successfully read a fiction book end-to-end, which shows just how much it grabbed me. I can&#8217;t recommend it highly enough, if you like space, science, or just a good story you should definitely check it out.

I can&#8217;t wait for the [movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ue4PCI0NamI) now.
