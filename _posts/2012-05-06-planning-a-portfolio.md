excerpt: "I'm at a stage where I've got loads of new work to add to my portfolio but I don't want to add them to this site, so I'm planning a rebuild from the ground up. In the four years since I've had this site the web has changed a lot and so have I. I'm working out what I want from a new site at the moment."

I&#8217;m at a stage where I&#8217;ve got loads of new work to add to my portfolio but I don&#8217;t want to add it to this site, so I&#8217;m planning a rebuild from the ground up. In the four years since I&#8217;ve had this site the web has changed a lot and so have I. I&#8217;m working out what I want from a new site at the moment.
