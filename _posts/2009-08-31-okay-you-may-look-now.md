From the initial sketch to the (almost) finished article in a month. You are looking at version 1 of my site. This is the first time I have built a site for myself and it&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;ve built something this large on WordPress.

There are still some things that need my attention until I can relax, including the measure in blog posts (feel a bit short to anyone else?), IE6 testing and finally I need to build the portfolio section (and get rid of the &#8216;coming soon&hellip;&#8217; placeholders). I&#8217;m holding off on the latter until I get a few jobs under my belt.

In the meantime please take a look around, feel free to critique and [report bugs](#contact "Skip to contact form") to your heart&#8217;s content
