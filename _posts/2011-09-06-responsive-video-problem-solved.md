<a href="http://twitter.com/chriscoyier" target="_blank">Chris Coyier</a> and <a href="http://paravelinc.com/" target="_blank">Paravel</a> have joined forces and written jQuery plugin called <a href="http://fitvidsjs.com/" target="_blank">FitVids</a> to solve the biggest challenge with responsive design: embedded videos.

Until now writing code that can resize videos from every service, at every size, without serving multiple versions or ending up with a ruined aspect ratio has been damned near impossible.

<a href="http://fitvidsjs.com/" target="_blank">FitVids</a> makes it simple, really simple. I&#8217;ve implemented it on this site tonight with no trouble at all and I will keep it in my back pocket for future work. Thanks guys.
