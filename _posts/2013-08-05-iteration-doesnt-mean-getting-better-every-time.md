I just wanted to clear something up about iteration, it&#8217;s a fairly common misconception about an iterative design process, one that I catch myself out on a lot.

Iterating on something, whether it be a product, a design or a process doesn&#8217;t mean getting better every time. There is no guarantee that every iteration will be an improvement over the last, but over a longer timeframe you will see significant improvements.

An important part of an iterative process is providing an environment where mistakes can be made, where hunches can be test run and validated, and accepted conventions challenged.

Releasing an iteration that is perceived as &#8216;worse&#8217; is not a failure, but part of a valid and essential of the process. As long as you keep iterating.
