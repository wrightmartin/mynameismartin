  * Is a user&#8217;s name a good enough label for a &#8216;manage account’ button?
  * Does a contact form get higher conversions if the message field comes first or if the other fields come first?
  * Does a search field perform worse without a &#8216;submit&#8217; button?
  * Can you replace the word ‘search’ with a magnifying glass icon and expect similar (or better) recognition from users?
  * How much does adding a single extra field to a form affect completion rates?
  * How does putting the label within the form field affect completion rates?
