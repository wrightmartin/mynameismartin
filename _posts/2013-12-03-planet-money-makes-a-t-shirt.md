NPR&#8217;s Planet Money podcast make a t-shirt and follow it around the world, from harvesting of the cotton, right to the end of the manufacturing process. It&#8217;s a super interesting story, that uses storytelling through the web and video to explain a complex process in an approachable way. I&#8217;d love to see other subjects tackled in this way, like politics or the economy.
