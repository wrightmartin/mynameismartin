  Surely there is a better way to judge customer satisfaction than an intrusive, distracting pop-up window that demands my attention?

  If you do get me to fill out your satisfaction survey I will be biased because you have asked for it so arrogantly. You can&#8217;t rely on the results you get if you&#8217;ve annoyed your customer by asking.
