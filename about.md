Hello, I&#8217;m Martin Wright, a friendly designer based in Shrewsbury in the UK.
I&#8217;m a web designer with over ten years&#8217; experience building websites for varied clients and industries. I make websites that work well and look beautiful on screens large and small.

I&#8217;ve had various roles in the web industry, and have had the pleasure of working with some diverse clients like the University of Oxford, the WWF and the RNIB. I believe the web should be used for social good and that&#8217;s the kind of work I like to do.

I was born in Reading but spent my teenage years in Perth, Western Australia before moving back to the UK and settling in Shrewsbury.
I dabbled in web design during college, throwing together websites for bands which gave me a taste for the immediacy of making things on the internet. 

I took Computer Science at University, where I became interested in human-computer interaction and user interface design. My web skills helped me develop this interest, and helped me write my dissertation computer aided learning and video game reward systems.

After university I talked my way into a web development job for my local council, where I learnt the benefit of rapid prototyping in a &#8216;demo or die&#8217; culture. After being promoted to Web Team Leader I pushed the department to work in a more open and transparent way, starting a <a href="http://shropshire.gov.uk/projectwip">team blog</a> and a public prototype of a <a href="http://new.shropshire.gov.uk">new Shropshire.gov.uk</a>. Happily the team have continued to develop this work and I follow it closely.

The work my team and I did at Shropshire was well received in the industry and on the back of this I landed a job at <a href="http://torchbox.com">Torchbox</a>, where I worked for a wide range of clients on some challenging and exciting projects.

Now I work for <a href="http://mysociety.org">mySociety</a>, where I design in-house products and projects for citizens and democratic groups around the world.

I live in Shrewsbury with my gorgeous wife and two beautiful daughters. I like punk-rock, video games and the films of Wes Anderson. In my free time you can find me running, up a mountain on my bike, or watching Star Wars with the kids. Again.
