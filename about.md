<p class="lede">Hello, I&#8217;m Martin Wright, a friendly designer based in Shrewsbury in the UK.</p>

I&#8217;m a web designer with over fifteen years&#8217; experience experience designing websites and services for varied clients including central and local government, healthcare, and the charity sector. I’m a dedicated and experienced team lead, people manager, design practitioner, and lifelong learner. I’m passionate about working with people to deliver the very best user-centred design work.

<hr class="decorative-hr">

I&#8217;ve had various roles in the web industry, and have had the pleasure of working with some diverse clients like the University of Oxford, the WWF and the RNIB. I believe the web should be used for social good and that&#8217;s the kind of work I like to do.

I was born in Reading but spent my teenage years in Perth, Western Australia before moving back to the UK and settling in Shrewsbury.
I dabbled in web design during college, throwing together websites for bands which gave me a taste for the immediacy of making things on the internet. 

I took Computer Science at University, where I became interested in human-computer interaction and user interface design. My web skills helped me develop this interest, and I wrote my dissertation on computer aided learning and reward systems.

After university I was Web Team Leader for my local council, where I learnt the benefit of rapid prototyping in a &#8216;demo or die&#8217; culture. During my time there I pushed the council to work in the open, starting a web development blog and a launching a public beta of a new Shropshire.gov.uk.

The work my team and I did at Shropshire was well received in the industry and on the back of this I landed a job at <a href="http://torchbox.com">Torchbox</a>, where I worked for a wide range of clients in the charity and education sectors.

In 2013 I joined the team at <a href="http://mysociety.org">mySociety</a>, where I designed web products and projects for citizens, governments, and similar groups around the world. Work I found immensely satisfying.

Building on this, since 2021 I've worked for <a href="http://tpximpact.com">TPXimpact</a> (formerly Futuregov) as a design lead, working on Central Government user-centred design projects

I live in Shrewsbury with my wife and two daughters. I like punk-rock, video games and the films of Wes Anderson. In my free time you can find me running, up a mountain on my bike, or watching Star Wars with the kids. Again.
