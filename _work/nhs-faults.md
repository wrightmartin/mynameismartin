I was the design lead on this project, we interviewed staff from various trusts and departments, designed and prototyped a service built around their needs and produced a package of work appraised under the NHSx Service Standard assessments.

We found, through a user centred design process, that the need was valid, and working within the constraints of the client and contractual relationship  established a case to take the project to Beta, built around our findings.
