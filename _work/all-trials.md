Ben's team had a dataset they'd assembled with qualitative and quantitive data describing how much rigour and transparency trials were performed with, and asked us to design and build a front end that could help people view and understand the data, which ranked companies according to their transparency index.

We built a clean and accessible site that presented the data in a clear and informative way, and used various data visualisations to help users understand the data with added context.

With the assistance of his team, we presented the data on each company according to four scores and showed where the companies trials' were problematic or potentially scientifically dubious.
