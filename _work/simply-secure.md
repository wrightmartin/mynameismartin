As the sole designer, I was responsible for the brand, illustration, website design and build. I worked closely with their team to establish an appealing design direction, designed to contrast with the status quo of the established IT security industry.

We settled on a human design with bright, fresh colours and tongue-in cheek-illustrations in a flat and simple style. Alongside the website, I delivered a branding system that we based print, event and multimedia design projects on.
