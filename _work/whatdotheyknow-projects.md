The aim of the project was to give pro users the ability to invite and delegate work to colleagues and volunteers to save time on laborious tasks, such as identifying holding messages, autoreplies and refusals, and free them up to deal with the more complex tasks.

We worked closely with several established users of the product to add features that met their needs and put many measures in place to judge the success of the features, ensuring time saved was quantified and valuable - potentially a huge saving for what are usually underfunded and overworked people.
