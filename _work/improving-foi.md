As a statutory service, every public sector organisation must answer these requests within certain timeframes, to a level of quality or they are financially penalised. Running this service is a complex task, and typically is not just a technology problem, but one of knowledge management and staff expertise.

Through a series of user research interviews, technology discoveries and prototyping we delivered our outputs and findings, outlining how to evaluate an organisation's ability to run the service, technological improvements and the potential savings available. 

As part of this we developed a model to compare organisationsâ€™ abilities to handle these requests, and suggest areas of improvement.
