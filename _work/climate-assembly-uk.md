I was the Design Lead on the project where we designed and developed a website to facilitate the event and provide a central source of information for the assembly members themselves, the media, researchers, campaigners and the wider general public. 

Before the event the site provided information for potential members, chosen from across the UK, and for the media. During the event the site was where the live streams were available to view, and minutes and transcriptions were provided in near real time. And post-event, the site has become an archive of the proceeding, and hosts the fully accessible HTML event report.
