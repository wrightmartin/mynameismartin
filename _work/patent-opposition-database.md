We worked with the MSF team to design a website to support the process, which began with a large data set of patents, often in inaccessible PDFs requiring extensive medical and pharmaceutical knowledge to understand.

The site was built on a crowdsourcing model, enabling those with the medical know-how to examine patents and find opportunities to challenge them, which they can add to the site using an annotation tool which we prototyped and tested with their users.
