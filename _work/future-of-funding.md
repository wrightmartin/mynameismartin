My role as Design Lead is to establish a design process to provide repeatability and predictability to what is a politically volatile and often changing part of government, and to help a new team understand how they'll work together over the course of the project.

Working at a strategic level, my goal is to help the team understand how their work fits into a wider context, producing artefacts such as maps, process diagrams, journey maps and principles. Designing and facilitating workshops, giving feedback and direction of design work and being a visible member of the leadership team. 

This project involves working to the Government Design Service Standard, using established principles, conventions and components. Alongside this, providing high level design support, mentoring and leadership to the team members.
