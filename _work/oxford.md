In what was a complex make up of stakeholders we brought the administration, academics and colleges together to agree high level design principles to help with tricky decision making later on when it came to balancing the various competing business needs.

We produced HTML and hi-fidelity prototypes, various design directions and through several workshops tested and agreed on an approach that could help achieve the desired outcomes. 

The site went on to win Higher Education Website of the Year in 2015 and 2016
