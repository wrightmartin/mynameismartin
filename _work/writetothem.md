WriteToThem, one of the first mySociety projects is a simple concept, allowing members of the public to write to their elected representatives, without the need to know them by name.

Based around a postcode lookup, and a workflow long proven to be effective, our redesign focused on adding a more comfortable writing experience, better edge case support and a content overhaul aimed at encouraging responsible use of the site.
